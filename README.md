## PROBLEM STATEMENT

1. Lack of availability of a centralized platform for bank and organ banking systems
2. Lack of integration between organizations like Healthcare, Supply Chain, Clinical, Donor Banks
3. This creates a lot of gaps when a patient is in dire need of a blood or organ transplant.

## SOLUTION

1. We’re providing a centralized, integrated and global solution to solve the donation issue in healthcare domain
2. At “Northeast Valley Lifecare”, we aim to bring together all the players – Healthcare, Supply Chain, Clinical, and Organ Banks and to understand the pain points from all the stakeholders and address.
3. We aspire to minimize the end-to-end lifecycle of a patient received a transplant which includes multiple operations like organ donation, clinical verification, logistics, etc.
